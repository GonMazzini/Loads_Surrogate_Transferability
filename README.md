# Loads_Surrogate_Transferability

The project aims to explore the suitability of transfer learning for adapting loads surrogate models 
developed in academia for industrial siting applications. Transfer learning implies re-using of a pretrained model on a new problem, for which less data is available wrt. to the database used for training
the original model. The sense behind transfer learning is to exploit knowledge gained from a previous 
task to improve generalization about another
